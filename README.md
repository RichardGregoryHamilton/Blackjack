Blackjack
=========

Blackjack is a popular gambling game played in casinos. Also known as 21, the game pits a player against a dealer in a card game.

Players are given two cards and must keep track of the sum of the values of the cards

Card Values
===========
2 - 2
3 - 3
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 7
8 - 8
9 - 9
10 - 10
Jack - 10
Queen - 10
King - 10
Ace - 1 or 11

Gameplay
========
For example say you are dealt two cards, an 8 of Hearts and a 4 of Clubs

The sum of these 2 cards is (8 + 4) or 12.

Your objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. You are given two choices. 

Hit - You can draw another card
Stay - You don't draw another card and retain this value.

Let's say you draw another card, a 7 of Spades

The sum of your 3 cards is now (8 + 4 + 7) or 19.

You again have the option to either hit or stay. However, if you choose to hit now and draw a 3 of Diamonds, the sum of your cards will be 22, which is higher than the 21 threshold. You will lose your bet.

If both the player and the dealer have the same total, it results in a push, meaning you will get back the money you bet.

STRATEGY
========

Typically, when the value of the sum of your cards is less than 16, you want to hit.

At 15, it is more likely to draw a card that will bring the sum to 21 or less, than one that will bring the sum over 21.
